			<li>For more information about our Acceptable Use Policy, please click <a href="http://www.corp.att.com/aup/" title="Acceptable Use Policy">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This page provides additional information that the Federal Communications Commission has identified as useful to consumers and to the providers of Internet applications and content used by those consumers. Specifically, we describe the network practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms applicable to our mass market wired, mobile and Wi-Fi broadband Internet access services.* We encourage all consumers and other users of our network to familiarize themselves with this information, and to provide AT&amp;T with feedback about our broadband Internet access services so that we can continue to provide the best service experience possible.</p>
		<p>AT&amp;T has long been committed to maintaining an open Internet that provides consumers with competitive choices, and access to lawful websites and information when, where and how they want it.  As we approach new Internet-related business opportunities, design new services, and manage our network, we are guided by and comply with the FCC&rsquo;s Open Internet Order, Net Neutrality rules, and our own core standards for addressing the needs of our customers. These standards are:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li><strong>Freedom</strong> &ndash; Consumers should be able to openly exchange ideas, content, and information across the Internet.</li>
			<li><strong>Innovation</strong> &ndash; Consumers are entitled to a robust and secure network that enables new services, applications, and devices.</li>

		<p>For more information about our Open Internet Policy, please <a href="http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/pdf/ATT_Net_Neutrality_Policy_Statement.pdf" target="_blank" title="AT&amp;T Open Internet Policy Statement">click here</a>.</p>
		<h2 class="accent1" id="network-practices">Network Practices</h2>
		<h3>How does AT&amp;T manage congestion with respect to its broadband Internet access services?</h3>
		<p>We want to provide a high-quality Internet experience for all of our customers. Our wired, mobile and Wi-Fi broadband Internet access services are provided over networks that support millions of customers at the same time. With this volume, congestion may occur when a large number of customers in a particular area access the network at the same time or when some customers consume a very large amount of network capacity during busy periods, such as at stadium events or during early evenings.</p>
		<p>To address potential network congestion, AT&amp;T has been investing billions of dollars to add more capacity to our broadband networks. We also have developed data plans for our wired and mobile broadband Internet access services so that our customers&#39; rates better reflect their usage levels. The vast majority of our customers will not incur additional usage charges based on the data plans. For more information, please click <a href="broadbandinfo.html#rates-data-plans" title="potential network congestion">here</a>.</p>
		<p>AT&amp;T provides usage calculators and other tools for our wired and mobile services to assist consumers in estimating their anticipated usage levels. We also send notices to our customers when they are approaching the applicable usage thresholds for our tiered wired and mobile services. For more information about these tools and notices, please click <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/internet/usage.jsp#fbid=rcjF7LTm-gy" title="here">here</a> (wired) and <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/data-plans.jsp" title="here">here</a>&nbsp;(mobile).</p>
		<p>For our mobile broadband services, we've also developed a process to reduce the data throughput speed experienced by a very small minority of smartphone customers who are on unlimited plans &mdash; those who use 3 gigabytes of data or more in a billing period on a 3G or 4G smartphone, or 5 gigabytes or more on a 4G LTE smartphone. These customers will experience reduced speeds once their usage in a billing cycle reaches the applicable 3 or 5 gigabyte threshold for their smartphone. They can still use unlimited data and their speeds will be restored with the start of the next billing cycle. We will notify customers before the first time they are affected by this process. This reduced data throughput process will not apply to smartphone customers on a tiered data plan. For information about this process, please click <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/datausage.jsp?source=IZDUel1160000000U" title="reduced data throughput process">here</a>.</p>
		<p>AT&amp;T recently enabled Facetime over the cellular network for subscribers using certain iPhone devices. To address potential network congestion resulting from Facetime usage, AT&amp;T initially enabled Facetime over cellular only for Mobile Share customers while we evaluate the impact Facetime has on the cellular network. iPhone customers with other data plans may continue to use Facetime on the Wi-Fi network. </p>
<h3>Does AT&amp;T favor certain Internet applications by blocking, throttling or modifying particular protocols on its broadband Internet access service?</h3>
		<p>No, AT&amp;T does not favor certain Internet applications by blocking, throttling or modifying particular protocols, protocol ports, or protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standards. However, in response to a specific security threat against our network or our customers, AT&amp;T may occasionally need to limit the flow of traffic from certain locations or take other appropriate actions. In addition, we prevent the use of certain ports on our wired and Wi-Fi broadband services to protect our customers and network against malicious activity, as discussed below.</p>
		<h3>What types of security practices does AT&amp;T use on its network?</h3>
		<p>AT&amp;T takes the security of our customers and our network very seriously. We proactively monitor our network to guard against a wide range of security threats, including viruses, botnets, worms, distributed denial of service attacks, SPAM, and other harmful activity.</p>
		<p>If we detect a security threat, we will typically attempt to isolate that threat and prevent it from spreading across our network. We may use a variety of security measures to prevent the spread of a threat, which may include temporarily limiting the flow of traffic over some portions of our network or taking other actions to address the threat. We attempt to limit those actions to the specific portions of our network or customer base impacted by the security threat and for only as long as necessary to mitigate the threat. In addition, consistent with recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for guarding against SPAM, AT&amp;T prevents the use of Port 25 for sending email on our wired consumer broadband Internet access services. For more information regarding the FTC&#39;s recommendations, please click <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/05/zombies.shtm" title="FTC's recommendations" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>For our Wi-Fi services, which are accessible in a wide range of commercial establishments and public venues, AT&amp;T prevents the use of certain ports that are commonly used to spread malware and engage in other malicious activity. For more information about our Wi-Fi security practices, please click <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=9182" title="Wi-Fi security practices">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Does AT&amp;T restrict the types of devices that customers can use with its broadband Internet access services?</h3>
		<p>AT&amp;T customers may attach 3G- or 4G-capable devices of their choice to our wired, mobile and Wi-Fi broadband Internet access services, so long as the devices do not harm our network or other users. AT&amp;T will not activate 2G-only capable devices. The devices must also be used in a manner consistent with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. </p>
<p>For our mobile services, consumers will need to ensure that the device they wish to attach is FCC-approved and compatible with the technology used in our mobile network. </p>
		<h2 class="accent1" id="performance-characteristics">Performance Characteristics</h2>
		<h3>What factors affect the performance of my broadband Internet access service?</h3>
		<p>Your broadband Internet access service performance can be affected by a wide range of factors, many of which are beyond the control of AT&amp;T. The capabilities of the server with which you are communicating, the capacity of the network to which that server is attached, the 
			distance and number of routers (or &quot;hops&quot;) between your device and the other Internet end point you are contacting, and general congestion on the Internet are common factors that can affect performance, regardless of your service type. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li><em>Wired Services</em>. Service performance may be affected by the wiring inside your dwelling, the distance between your dwelling and an AT&amp;T central office, the capabilities of your computer, and the applications you use. In addition, to provide our U-verse customers with a consistently high-quality video service, the speed of AT&amp;T U-verse broadband Internet access service may be temporarily reduced when a customer is using his or her U-verse video service in a manner that requires high bandwidth.

			<li><em>Mobile Services</em>. Service performance may be affected by your proximity to a cell site, the capacity of the cell site, the number of other users connected to the same cell site, the surrounding terrain, use inside a building or a moving vehicle, radio frequency interference, the capabilities of your device, and the applications you use.</li>
			<li><em>Wi-Fi Services</em>. Service performance may be affected by your proximity to a Wi-Fi hot spot, the capacity of the Wi-Fi equipment at the hot spot, the number of other users connected to the same site, the composition of the building where the hot spot is located (wood, concrete, etc.), radio frequency interference, the capabilities of your laptop, netbook or other Wi-Fi capable device, and the applications you use.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Where can I find information about the speed and latency of my broadband Internet access service?</h3>
		<p>Because of all the different factors that can affect the performance of your broadband Internet access service, AT&amp;T does not guarantee specific levels of speed or latency for our mass market services. We will provide you with the best available performance from our network. The performance you can expect to receive from the services we offer is described below. </p>
		<h4>Speed</h4>
		<p>The term &quot;speed&quot; is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular broadband Internet access service can transmit data. This capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits or megabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps or Mbps). Some applications like email or basic web browsing do not require a substantial amount of speed to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed services.</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li><em>Wired Service</em>. AT&amp;T offers mass market wired broadband Internet access services in discrete speed tiers. This means that our wired broadband Internet access customers should expect to see <a href="http://www.att.net/csbellsouth/s/s.dll?spage=cg/legal/att.htm&amp;leg=tos" title="Service Capability Speeds"><em>Service Capability Speeds</em></a> within the speed tier of their service plan. For example, a customer with AT&amp;T&#39;s High Speed Internet Elite Service should expect service capability download speeds between 3.1 and 6.0 Mbps. Please visit <a href="http://www.att.net/speedtiers" title="download speeds">www.att.net/speedtiers</a> to learn more. To find out which speed tier is well-suited for the types of applications you use most often, please click <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/internet/index.jsp?wtSlotClick=1-005VJG-0-7&amp;tab=2#fbid=2N77RAx0nm7" title="find out which speed tier is well-suited for the types of applications">here</a>.</li>
			<li><em>Mobile Service</em>. AT&amp;T does not offer mass market mobile broadband Internet access service in different speed tiers. Instead, our mobile broadband Internet access service is designed to provide customers with the highest speed available from the network on a given device at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors discussed above that can impact wireless network performance. For our High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) services, typical download speeds range from approximately  700 Kbps up to 1.7 Mbps, and for HSPA+ typical download speeds range from approximately 2 Mbps up to 6 Mbps where AT&amp;T has <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB115944#fbid=TaTXHwRdHUd" title="enhanced backhaul" target="_blank">enhanced backhaul</a> connections in place. For our Long Term Evolution (LTE) services, typical download speeds range from approximately 5 Mbps up to 12 Mbps in most markets. For more information about the capabilities and performance of our mobile broadband Internet access services, please click <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/why/technology/mobile-broadband-and-GSM.jsp" title="here">here</a>.**</li>
			<li><em>Wi-Fi Service</em>. AT&amp;T&#39;s Wi-Fi broadband Internet access service is designed to provide customers with the highest speed available from the network at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors discussed above that can affect network performance. AT&amp;T&#39;s Wi-Fi services generally support the 802.11b/g standards, with some AT&amp;T locations also supporting the 802.11n standard. Although the 802.11 b/g/n standards have theoretical maximum speeds ranging from over ten Mbps to several hundred Mbps, actual Wi-Fi speeds are likely to be substantially lower than the theoretical maximum speeds. In addition to the factors discussed above, the actual speed you experience over Wi-Fi will depend in part on the speed of the connection between the Wi-Fi hotspot you are accessing and the destination you want to reach on the Internet, which may be significantly below the theoretical maximum speed of the service. For more information about AT&amp;T&#39;s Wi-Fi broadband Internet access service, please click <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=9182" title="AT&amp;T's Wi-Fi broadband Internet">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Latency</h4>
		<p>Latency, also known as delay, is the amount of time from when a data packet is sent to when it is received. For broadband Internet access services, latency is usually expressed as the round-trip time in milliseconds that it takes for a data packet to travel between two end points on the Internet (from point A to point B and then back to point A). Some applications, such as email, can tolerate a substantial amount of latency without any noticeable impact on the application&#39;s performance, while other applications, such as real-time video conferencing, require lower latency to function properly.</p>

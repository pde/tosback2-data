All of our courses use Angel technology, which means you will have a consistent format in each of the classes you take. At the start of each course, you will enter an Angel tutorial to familiarize you with the online structure. In your account, you will have access to everything including your course syllabus, staff information, as well as discussion boards and a digital drop box, where you will \\\"turn in\\\" all of your assignments.</p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"position: relative;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tHow It Works</h2><p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">For each course you are enrolled in, you can plan to invest 10-12 hours per week. Interaction is asynchronous, so you sign on, respond to message boards, and see professor notes, all on your time and at your own convenience. <span style=\\\"color: #3b3b3b; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;\\\">Students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average).</span></p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tIn the Classroom</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">Students take two courses each sixteen-week semester \u2014 divided into eight week segments. Courses are focused. We believe that concentration on one class at a time affords you time to take maximum advantage of each lesson. New classes start every two months.</p>\\n<p>Exams will be taken electronically through the Angel system. However, most courses use alternative methods of assessment, such as portfolios, research papers and projects.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">All of Grand Canyon University's online courses are uniquely tailored to meet your needs. Our professors work hard to create an optimal online learning environment. That means you get feedback and have the opportunity to ask questions of your professor as well as to other students who are in your course of study.</p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tCourse Requirements</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Although classes do not meet at a specific time and place, students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average), and meet assignment deadlines and requirements for interaction with instructor and course peers. Students progress through the course as a class and participate in an online community. The program is not independent study.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Our programs may be the most student-friendly courses offered by any university.

All of our courses use Angel technology, which means you will have a consistent format in each of the classes you take. At the start of each course, you will enter an Angel tutorial to familiarize you with the online structure. In your account, you will have access to everything including your course syllabus, staff information, as well as discussion boards and a digital drop box, where you will \\\"turn in\\\" all of your assignments.</p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"position: relative;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tHow It Works</h2><p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">For each course you are enrolled in, you can plan to invest 10-12 hours per week. Interaction is asynchronous, so you sign on, respond to message boards, and see professor notes, all on your time and at your own convenience. <span style=\\\"color: #3b3b3b; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;\\\">Students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average).</span></p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tIn the Classroom</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">Students take two courses each sixteen-week semester \u2014 divided into eight week segments. Courses are focused. We believe that concentration on one class at a time affords you time to take maximum advantage of each lesson. New classes start every two months.</p>\\n<p>Exams will be taken electronically through the Angel system. However, most courses use alternative methods of assessment, such as portfolios, research papers and projects.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">All of Grand Canyon University's online courses are uniquely tailored to meet your needs. Our professors work hard to create an optimal online learning environment. That means you get feedback and have the opportunity to ask questions of your professor as well as to other students who are in your course of study.</p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tCourse Requirements</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Although classes do not meet at a specific time and place, students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average), and meet assignment deadlines and requirements for interaction with instructor and course peers. Students progress through the course as a class and participate in an online community. The program is not independent study.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Our programs may be the most student-friendly courses offered by any university.

All of our courses use Angel technology, which means you will have a consistent format in each of the classes you take. At the start of each course, you will enter an Angel tutorial to familiarize you with the online structure. In your account, you will have access to everything including your course syllabus, staff information, as well as discussion boards and a digital drop box, where you will \\\"turn in\\\" all of your assignments.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">For each course you are enrolled in, you can plan to invest 10-12 hours per week. Interaction is asynchronous, so you sign on, respond to message boards, and see professor notes, all on your time and at your own convenience. <span style=\\\"color: #3b3b3b; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;\\\">Students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average).</span></p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tIn the Classroom</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"left: auto; top: auto;\\\">Students take two courses each sixteen-week semester \u2014 divided into eight week segments. Courses are focused. We believe that concentration on one class at a time affords you time to take maximum advantage of each lesson. New classes start every two months.</p>\\n<p>Exams will be taken electronically through the Angel system. However, most courses use alternative methods of assessment, such as portfolios, research papers and projects.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">All of Grand Canyon University's online courses are uniquely tailored to meet your needs. Our professors work hard to create an optimal online learning environment. That means you get feedback and have the opportunity to ask questions of your professor as well as to other students who are in your course of study.</p>\\n<h3 style=\\\"display: none;\\\" class=\\\"one\\\">\\n\\tCourse Requirements</h3>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Although classes do not meet at a specific time and place, students are expected to \\\"attend\\\" to their course by log-in four times per week (on average), and meet assignment deadlines and requirements for interaction with instructor and course peers. Students progress through the course as a class and participate in an online community. The program is not independent study.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"display: none;\\\">Our programs may be the most student-friendly courses offered by any university.

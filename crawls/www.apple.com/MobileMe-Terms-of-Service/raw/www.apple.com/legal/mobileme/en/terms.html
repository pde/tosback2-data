			<h1>MobileMe Terms of Service</h1>

			<h2>1.	Your Acceptance of Terms</h2>
			<h3>Welcome to MobileMe</h3>
			<p>The following Terms of Service (“TOS”) are between you and Apple and constitute a legal agreement that governs your use of the MobileMe product, software, services and websites (collectively referred to as the “Service”). You must agree to these TOS before you can use the Service. You can agree to these TOS by: a) actually using the Service, or b) clicking a box that indicates you agree to the Service, where such a box is made available to you. If you do not agree to any of the following terms, please do not use the Service. You should print  or otherwise save  a copy of these TOS for your records. "Apple" as used herein means Apple Inc., located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California and, where applicable, Apple Sales International, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Ireland.</p>
			<h3>Legal Authority</h3>
			<p>To use and/or register for the Service you must be: a) of legal age to form a binding contract with Apple, and b) cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. By accepting these TOS you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing. If you are under the required legal age, but at least 13 years old,  you may still use the Service (subject to applicable local law), but only if the account you are using was created and registered by your parent or legal guardian (see Section 3 below for further details).</p>
			<h3>Updates</h3>
			<p>Apple may update or change these TOS from time to time and recommends that you review  the TOS on a regular basis. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/mobileme/">http://www.apple.com/legal/mobileme/</a>. If Apple makes a change to the TOS, it will post the revised TOS on our website at the link as herein noted. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service after the TOS has changed constitutes your acceptance of the TOS as revised. Without limiting the foregoing, if Apple makes a change to the TOS that materially impacts your use of the Service, Apple may post notice of any such change on our website and/or email you notice of any such change to your MobileMe account.</p>

			<h2>2.	Description of the Service</h2>
			<h3>System Requirements </h3>
			<p>Use of the Service requires one or more compatible devices, certain software and internet access with compatible ISP (broadband required for web applications); separate fees may apply. Some portions of the Service require Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard and iLife ’08 or later, available separately. Your use of the Service may be affected by certain combinations of hardware, software and/or internet access. High speed internet access is strongly recommended. Compatible device: Mac, PC, iPhone, or iPod touch. For Mac: Mac OS X v10.5.8, v10.6.2, or later; Safari 3, Firefox 3, or later. For PC: Windows 7, Vista or  XP Home or Professional (SP2) or later; Internet Explorer 7, Safari 3, Firefox 3, or later; (Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later recommended).

The Service is available in the following languages: English, French, Japanese and German.</p>
			<h3>Changing the Service </h3>
			<p>Apple reserves the right to modify or stop the Service (or any part thereof), either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, with or without prior notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, Apple may post on our website and/or send email to your MobileMe account, notice of such changes to the Service. It is your responsibility to  review our website and/or check your MobileMe email address for any such notices.  You agree that Apple shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the Service.</p>
			<h3>Limitations on Use</h3>
			<p>You agree to use the Service only for purposes as permitted by these TOS and any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable jurisdiction. Your MobileMe account is allocated certain levels of storage capacity and bandwidth for network traffic and email as described in the MobileMe feature pages. Exceeding any applicable limitation of bandwidth or storage capacity (for example, iDisk or e-mail account space) is prohibited. To view your current storage and data transfer or bandwidth allocations, log in to your MobileMe account page at <a href="https://secure.me.com/account">https://secure.me.com/account</a>. In addition, if there is Excessive Usage on your account or any Sub-account (as defined in Section 3 below) , Apple reserves the right to temporarily disable access to information available from your account through a URL, or to "bounce" emails back to senders. “Excessive Usage“ as used herein, may apply to storage and/or bandwidth capacities, and means your usage within a given month or day (as applicable) greatly exceeds the average level of monthly or daily usage of MobileMe’s members generally. Repeated violations may result in termination of your account. Apple reserves the right to modify these limitations on use at any time.</p>
			<h3>Availability of the Service</h3>
			<p>The Service, or any feature or part thereof, may not be available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no representation that the Service, or any feature or part thereof,  is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Service, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including, but not limited to, any applicable local laws.</p>
			<h3>Public Beta</h3>
			<p>From time to time, Apple may choose to offer new and/or updated features of the Service (the “Beta Features”) as part of a Public Beta Program (the “Program”) for the purpose of providing Apple with feedback on the quality and usability of the Beta Features. You understand and agree that your participation in the Program is voluntary and does not create a legal partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and Apple, and  that Apple is not obligated to provide you with any Beta Features. Apple may make such Beta Features available to Program participants by online registration or enrollment via the Service. You understand and agree that Apple may collect and use certain information from your account, devices and peripherals in order to enroll you in a Program and/or determine your eligibility to participate. You understand that once you enroll in a Program you may be unable to revert back to the earlier non-beta version of a given Beta Feature. In the event such reversion is possible, you may not be able to migrate data created within the Beta Feature back to the earlier non-beta version. Your use of the Beta Features and participation in the Program is governed by these TOS and any additional license terms that may separately accompany the Beta Features. The Beta Features are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information from your device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and computers) connected thereto. Apple strongly encourages you to back-up all data and information on your device and any peripherals prior to participating in any Program. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of the Beta Features is at your sole risk. <strong>YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS AND ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ANY PROGRAM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INTERNET ACCESS FEES, BACK-UP EXPENSES, COSTS INCURRED FOR THE USE OF YOUR DEVICE AND PERIPHERALS, AND ANY DAMAGE TO ANY EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, INFORMATION OR DATA.</strong> Apple may or may not provide you with technical and/or other support for the Beta Features. If support is provided it will be in addition to your normal support coverage for the Service and only available through the Program. You agree to abide by any support rules or policies that Apple provides to you in order to receive any such support. Apple reserves the right to modify the terms, conditions or policies of the Program (including ceasing the Program) at any time with or without notice, and may revoke your participation in the Program at any time. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide a commercial version of the Beta Features, and that should such a commercial version be made available, it may have features or functionality different than that contained in the Beta Features. As part of the Program, Apple will provide you with the opportunity to submit comments, suggestions, or other feedback regarding your use of the Beta Features. You agree that in the absence of a separate written agreement to the contrary, Apple will be free to use any feedback you provide for any purpose.</p>

			<h2>3.	Your Use of the Service</h2>

You are required to select a unique name upon sign up that will be used for your account (your “Subscriber ID”). You may be permitted to purchase and add additional “Sub-accounts” (also known as “Family Member” accounts) to your Member Account. You must select a separate Subscriber ID for each Sub-account you create. You are responsible for all activity that takes place on your Member Account and any associated Sub-accounts.</p>
			<h3>Sub-account</h3>
			<p>If you use a Sub-account, the Member Account holder has full control over your Sub-account and may alter, close or end the Sub-account at any time, as well as request information related to your use of the Sub-account, including machine and service use information, without notice to you.</p>
			<h3>Account Security</h3>
			<p>Upon creating your Subscriber ID you will be required to select a password. Please choose a strong password and do not reveal your password to others. You agree that you are responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure, and further understand that you are solely responsible and liable for any activities that occur under your Subscriber ID. If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your account please contact MobileMe Support at  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww">http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww</a>. Your further acknowledge and agree that the Service is designed and intended for personal use on an individual basis and you should not share your account and/or password details with another individual.</p>

			<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. Children between the ages of 13-18 (or older as required by local law) may be granted access to the Service but only if they are added as a Sub-account to a Member Account. By adding a child as a Sub-Account member under your Member Account, you certify that you are of legal age and are the parent and/or legal guardian of that child. By adding a minor to your Member Account, you give them permission to access and use the Service, and it is your responsibility to determine whether the Service and/or Content (as defined below in Section 5) provided via the Service is appropriate for a minor. Please also remind any minors that conversing with strangers on the internet can be dangerous and take appropriate precautions to protect your child including monitoring their use of the Service.</p>
			<h3>Sign Up Obligations</h3>
			<p>You agree that all information you provide to Apple during the sign up process (“Sign Up Data”) will be true, accurate, complete and current information, and that you shall maintain and update the Sign Up Data as needed throughout your term to keep it accurate and current. Failure to provide accurate, current and complete Sign Up Data may result in the suspension and/or termination of your account.</p>
			<h3>Additional Obligations or Terms of Use</h3>
			<p>Particular components or features of the Service, provided by Apple and/or its licensors,  may be subject to separate software or other license agreements or terms of use. You must read, accept, and agree to be bound  by any such separate agreement as a condition of using these particular components or features of the Service.</p>
			<h3>No Conveyance</h3>
			<p>Nothing in these TOS shall be construed to convey to you any interest, title, or license in a Subscriber ID, email address, domain name, iChat ID, or similar resource used by you in connection with the Service.</p>
			<h3>No Right of Survivorship</h3>
			<p>You agree that your MobileMe account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Subscriber  ID or Content within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your account may be terminated and all Content within your account deleted.

			<p>You agree that you will not reproduce, copy, duplicate, sell, resell, rent or trade the Service (or any part thereof) for any purpose.</p>

			<h3>Use of Location-based Services</h3>
			<p>Apple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services through the Service that rely upon device-based location information. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors may collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device, and you hereby agree and consent to Apple's and its partners' and licensors' collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of such location data to provide such services. <strong>In addition, by enabling and/or using any location-based services or features within the Service (e.g. Find My iPhone), you agree and consent to Apple collecting, using, processing and maintaining information related to your account, and any devices registered thereunder, for purposes of providing such location-based service or feature to you.</strong> Such information may include, but is not limited to, your Subscriber ID, device ID and name, device type and real-time geographic location of your device at time of your request. <strong>You may withdraw this consent at any time by not using the location-based features or by turning off the Find My iPhone or  Location Services settings (as applicable) on your device.</strong> When using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party's terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services. Any location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service.</p>

			<h3>Find My iPhone Feature</h3>
			<p>The Find My iPhone feature is intended for your personal use only, in locating, sending a message to, or remote locking or wiping your own device. If you believe your device has been stolen you should seek assistance from your local law enforcement and use the remote passcode lock or remote wipe feature to protect your data. THE LOCATION-BASED SERVICES OF THIS FEATURE ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE  FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.</p>

			<p>You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible or liable in any way for any Content provided by others and has no duty to pre-screen such Content. However, Apple reserves the right at all times to determine whether Content is appropriate and in compliance with these TOS, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify and/or remove Content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, if such Content is found to be in violation of these TOS or is otherwise objectionable.</p>
			<h3>Backup Your Content</h3>
			<p>You are responsible for backing up, to your own computer or other device, any important documents, images or other Content that you store or access via the Service. Apple does not guarantee or warrant that any Content you may store  or access through the Service will not be subject to inadvertent damage, corruption or loss.</p>
			<h3>Access to Your Account and Content</h3>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that Apple may access, use, preserve and/or disclose your account information and Content if legally required to do so or if we have a good faith belief that such access, use, disclosure, or preservation is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or request; (b) enforce these TOS, including investigation of any potential violation thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property or safety of Apple, its users or the public as required or pemitted by law.</p>
			<h3>Copyright Notice - DMCA</h3>
			<p>If you believe that any Content in which you claim copyright has been infringed by anyone using the Service,  please contact Apple's Copyright Agent as described in our Copyright Policy at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/claimsofcopyright.html">http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/claimsofcopyright.html</a>.  Apple may, in its sole discretion, suspend and/or terminate accounts of users that are found to be repeat infringers.</p>
			<h3>Violations of TOS</h3>
			<p>If while using the Service, you encounter Content you find inappropriate, or otherwise believe to be a violation of these TOS, you may report it by sending an email to <a href="mailto:abuse@me.com">abuse@me.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>6.	Payment</h2>
			<h3>Fees</h3>
			<p>You agree to pay all fees and charges specified when you signed up for the Service and any part thereof. All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g. sales, use, or value-added tax), unless otherwise stated, and you are solely responsible for the payment of any such taxes that may be imposed on your use of the Service.</p>
			<h3>Credit Card Authorization</h3>
			<p>You may be asked to provide Apple with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate and/or pay for any fees related to the  Service. Apple may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to a purchase to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. These pre-authorizations will  reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.</p>
			<h3>Payment Method</h3>
			<p>Apple will charge the annual subscription fee and any other additional fees you authorize to the charge or credit card account provided by you. By authorizing Apple to charge a credit card for the fees associated with your subscription, you are authorizing Apple to automatically continue charging that card (or any replacement card if the original card is renewed, lost, stolen, or changed for any reason by the card issuer, and the issuer informs Apple of the new replacement card account) for all fees or charges associated with your subscription including any renewal fees as described below. You authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and authorize Apple, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Apple, to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card account until such amounts are paid in full. You agree to provide Apple updated information on your credit card upon Apple’s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid. If payment is not received by Apple from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Apple.</p>
			<h3>Free Trial Period</h3>
			<p>Apple may offer you a one-time free trial period during which you can try out the Service for free (“Free Trial Period”). If you are participating in a Free Trial Period, you must cancel the Service by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring any charges. If you do not cancel the Service before the Free Trial Period expires, and we have informed you that the Service will automatically be converted into a paid subscription at the end of the Free Trial Period, then you authorize us to charge your credit card the applicable fees as indicated at the time you signed up for the Service. During the Free Trial Period, you agree that Apple will have the right (subject to applicable local law) to send you communications, notices and news about the Service to your MobileMe email address and to any alternate email address you may have provided. Local law may allow you to revoke your consent to receiving these communications at any time during the Free Trial Period. Upgrades to a Member Account (e.g. Family Pack or storage upgrade) are only available upon purchase of an annual subscription and are therefore not available to subscribers during the Free Trial Period. Apple reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit this Free Trial Period offer at any time.</p>
			<p>You may cancel your account at any time during the Free Trial Period by going to  the Account Options section at <a href="https://secure.me.com/account">https://secure.me.com/account</a>.  Upon cancelling your account, you will lose all access to the Service and any data or information stored within your account. (See "Effects of Termination” below for additional details.)</p>

			<h3>Automatic Renewal of Annual Subscription</h3>
			<p>When you sign up  online for the Service, your annual subscription will be set to automatically renew upon its expiration. This means that unless you cancel your account or change its renewal settings prior to its expiration, your account will automatically renew for another year.   At the time of renewal, we will charge your credit card the then-current fees to renew the Service. About thirty (30) days prior to your expiration date we will notify you by email to your MobileMe email address  that your account is about to renew and remind you that your credit card will be billed the indicated Service fees on the renewal date. You may change your renewal settings at any time by going to <a href="https://secure.me.com/account">https://secure.me.com/account</a>.</p>
			<h3>Account Information and Billing Inquiries</h3>
			<p>You may consult your MobileMe account management page at <a href="https://secure.me.com/account">https://secure.me.com/account</a> for details on your account information including payment method and billing currency. Apple shall send an electronic invoice to your MobileMe email address whenever any Service fees are charged to your account. If you believe you have been billed in error for the Service please notify us within 45 days of the billing date by contacting MobileMe Support at <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww">http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww</a>.</p>
			<h3>Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
			<p>All fees and charges paid by you in relation to the Service are nonrefundable, except as otherwise stated herein. Apple shall refund the applicable fees paid by you upon initial online sign up or renewal of the Service provided Apple receives such refund request within forty-five (45) days of the billing date for any such fees. To request a refund as described herein go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww">http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ww</a> for more details. Applicable local law may vary this policy.</p>
			<p>PLEASE NOTE: Boxed versions of the Service that are purchased through Apple Retail Stores, the Apple Online Store, or  third party resellers must be activated within nine (9) months of the date of purchase and are not subject to the foregoing refund terms. Boxed versions of the Service must be returned to the original place of purchase and must follow the returns and refunds policies of those stores. Please review the applicable Apple Sales Policy at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/sales_policies/">http://www.apple.com/legal/sales_policies/</a>.</p>

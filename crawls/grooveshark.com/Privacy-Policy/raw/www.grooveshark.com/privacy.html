        <li><strong>Anonymous information.</strong> EMG records Anonymous Information about Users of the Service, which is stored as necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, operate our business and improve the performance of the Site.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers.</strong> The term "Cookie" is a nickname for files that may be deposited onto a User's computer hard drive through use of the Service. Cookies are used to recognize repeat visits to the website, what pages are accessed, and what functionalities are used. The use of cookies is commonplace on the Internet and they take up minimal room on your computer hard drive. Cookies work by assigning a number to your computer that has a specific meaning to the assigning website. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any User. Unless you choose to provide us with information about you, we will never know who you are, even though our computer has previously deposited a cookie on your computer's hard drive. In addition, you may modify your Internet browser's settings to notify you whenever any website requests to deposit a cookie on your computer's hard drive. This notification option generally gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept or refuse a cookie before it is deposited. EMG employs the use of cookies to enable our systems to recognize your browser, to identify how and when the Service is visited.<br />
        Our advertising partners may also use cookies in order to deliver targeted advertising to you.  Other companies that advertise on our Website also have the ability to deposit a different cookie on your computer's hard drive in a process that we do not control. EMG maintains no liability for the depositing of such cookies, and both visitors and Users of the Service release EMG of all liability with respect to third party cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> EMG collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information. This information is needed to enable certain features the Service provides, and is stored for as long as you have an account, and as necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. Personally Identifiable Information, such as a User's email address, address of residence, or phone number, will not be shared with any third party without consent from the User unless otherwise stated in this Policy or the <a href="http://grooveshark.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveys/Sweepstakes.</strong> You may choose to answer surveys or enter sweepstakes posed through grooveshark.com by EMG and/or a third party. These third parties may obtain personal information that you voluntarily submit to them. This policy does not cover survey responses you voluntarily provide to any third party and/or survey, and EMG is not responsible for the collection and use of your personal information by these third parties. Survey responses you provide to EMG may be published, transferred, sold or licensed to third parties; however, no Personally Identifiable Information will be included with the survey responses except for that Personally Identifiable Information you provide as a survey response.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address Information.</strong> When you use the Service, the IP Address of the computer or network device making the request is stored. IP address information is stored for as long as necessary to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, operate our business and fulfill our legal obligations. This may be done without any notification to the User. </li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention.</strong> Except as provided herein, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

                <li><strong>Unsubscribe -</strong> If you unsubscribe for a mailing that we sent to you on behalf of a third party, we may share your removal instructions with the third party so that your email address may be added to that company’s list of people to whom they will no longer send emails to directly.</li>
